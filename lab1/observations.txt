I noticed from this lab that there is an important distinction between `..` and '..'. The first is important for calculating expressions while the latter is primarily used for takes without interpreting the contents. I also learned that we need to use 'bc' to use the basic calculator to calculate the area of a circle since it uses floating point numbers. Lastly, I observed that the there was an incorrect log-in from the code given. "Salgtash" needed to be changed to the user's correct username, otherwise the program would never get to the while loop.
